Healers Have To Die
===================

*Change log*
------------

**version 2.0.2 (2012-09-25):**

- Fix a bug where HHTD could crash if an NPC with a hyphen in its name healed.

- Replaced AceTimer-3.0 with LibShefkiTimer-1.0 to fix random 'Script ran too
  long' issues happening with AceTimer's current implementation.


**version 2.0.1 (2012-09-01):**

- Compatible with Mists of Pandaria

- Updated healers' [spell list][spelllist] (including Monk's): specialized
  healers detection should be perfectly accurate now. Do not hesitated to leave
  comments on the [spell list][spelllist] page.

- Fixed bug: 'NamePlateHooker.lua:452: attempt to index field '?' (a nil
  value)' which was caused by the fact that LibNameplate-1.0 fires twice when
  plates are hidden if TidyPlates is used.

- Fixed bug: Healers below the healing threshold could be flagged as healers if
  they were casting spells right after the player had logged in (player's
  maximum health being null at that specific time).

- Fix wrong description for the 'Heal amount threshold' slider which
  incorrectly said that it had no effect in PvP if the 'Healer specialization
  detection' option was checked. This was no longer true since HHTD 2.0.

- Many micro-optimizations in the combat log parser, especially for when the
  PVE option is disabled. The analyzer leaves even earlier in such cases. Not
  that it should have any noticeable impact for any user. However, if you take
  HHTD's user base as a whole, you could probably fry an egg per day with the
  saved power :-) Is this called green programming?

- Added support for [Italian localization][localization]


**version 2.0.0 (2012-06-03):**

- Nameplate markers now include the healer's rank (the lower the number, the better
  the healer).

- Nameplate markers are now resizable and movable (see the 'Name Plate
  Hooker' module's options).

- It's now possible to test how markers look like using the 'Test HHTD's
  behavior on current target' button in the general options (along with other
  HHTD's features).

- HHTD's core has been rewritten and reorganized with all the current features
  in mind making HHTD more effective and reliable.

- The logs have been improved, they are now sorted and include all healing
  spells cast by healers with emphasising for specialised healers' spells.

- The logs can now be disabled if the announcer module is enabled (they are no
  longer linked).

- Improved healer detection for PVP and PVE (faster and more reliable).

- Better handling of multi-instanced units in PVE (especially with nameplate
  markers), 

- Many small improvements and bug fixes.

- Localization is needed, if you want to contribute [you can directlty write your translations using this very link][localization].

**version 1.8.1 (2011-03-13):**

 - Updated version of LibNamePlate-1.0 (this should fix a Lua error some users experienced)
