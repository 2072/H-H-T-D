Healers Have To Die (for World of Warcraft)
===========================================


*Now you can spot those nasty healers instantly and help them to accomplish their destiny!*


This is a very simple and light add-on. It rings when you hover or target
a hostile unit (PVP and/or PVE) who healed someone else during the last 60
seconds (*can be configured*).
The current development version is now able to add a **red cross** over healer's name plates. (see the [screen-shot][redcross])

******************************************
* **NEW FEATURE in current alpha** (2011-01-09)

HHTD is now working for PVE!!
Many optimizations and enhancements, no longer report guardians or pet as healers.


* **NEW FEATURE in HHTD 1.5** (2010-10-26)

HHTD is now able to add a **red cross** above enemy name plates when they've
been caught healing.

**Note: in the current WoW live version (4.0.1) there is a bug with name plates**:

You need to uncheck the **'Sticky target'** option under
*Interface->Control* else some name plates may not be displayed.

******************************************

*type /hhtd to get a list of existing options through command line or use the graphical UI (/ace3)*
