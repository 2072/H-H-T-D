Healers Have To Die (for World of Warcraft)
===========================================


*Now you can spot those nasty healers instantly and help them to accomplish their destiny!*


This is a very simple and light add-on. It just rings when you hover or target
a unit of the opposite faction who healed someone else during the last 60
seconds (*can be configured*).

This add-on uses the Ace3 framework.
******************************************
* **NEW FEATURE** (2010-10-25)

([alpha version only][dev]): HHTD is now able to add a **red cross** above enemy
name plates when they've been caught healing. It's still a work in progress but it does
work!

**Note: in the current WoW live version (4.0.1) there is a bug with name plates**:

You need to uncheck the **'Sticky target'** option under
*Interface->Control* else some name plates may not be displayed.

******************************************

*type /hhtd to get a list of existing options*

**Comments and suggestions are welcome** :-)
