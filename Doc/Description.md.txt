Healers Have To Die
===================


*Spot those bloody healers instantly and help them accomplish their destiny! (PVP and PVE)*


HHTD adds a **red cross** over *enemy* healer's name plates. *You can't miss them!* (see the [screen-shot][redcross]).

HHTD adds a **healer role symbol** above*friendly* healers' name plates (since HHTD 1.8.0 only). *Stop the slaughter!!*

**IMPORTANT NOTE: You have to enable name-plates, else you won't see the healer symbol!**

It also rings when you hover or target a hostile unit who healed
someone else during the last 60 seconds (*can be configured*).

HHTD is PVP and PVE compatible.

******************************************

*type /hhtdg to open the configuration interface, or /hhtd for command-line access*
