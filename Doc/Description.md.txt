Healers Have To Die
===================


*Spot those bloody healers instantly and help them accomplish their destiny! (PVP and PVE)*


HHTD adds a **red cross** over *enemy* healer's name plates. *You can't miss them!* (see the [screen-shot][redcross]).

HHTD adds a **healer role symbol** above*friendly* healers' name plates. *Stop the slaughter!!*

**IMPORTANT NOTE: You have to enable name-plates, else you won't see the healer symbol!**

It also rings when you hover or target a hostile unit who healed
someone else during the last 60 seconds (*can be configured*).

HHTD is PVP and PVE compatible.

**HHTD uses the combat log events to detect friendly and enemy healers.
By default HHTD will detect specialized healers spells only (for PvP) another
option lets you choose a specified amount of healing ennemies have to reach
before being marked as healers. (this is the setting used for PVE)**

Self-Heals and pets are filtered out.

Remember to check out available options (/HHTDG)

An interesting debate about this add-on is happening on the official Blizzard's forum:
[Break the HHTD mod already. (UI and Macro forum)][debate4] (full),
[Healers Have To Die, part I (UI and Macro forum)][debate1] (full),
[Healers Have to Die, part II (General discussion)][debate2] (full),
[Healers Have to Die, part III (General discussion)][debate3],
[Healers Have to Die (Class Roles - Healing forum)][debate5]

Sadly, as a European I cannot participate but I'm reading those threads with great interest.

The funniest part about all those 26 pages discussions is that only about **12,000 people are actually using HHTD** (from the Curse Client popularity statistics)...
In those discussion it's also rarely noted that HHTD is also very helpful to protect healers on your side.
