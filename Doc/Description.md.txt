Healers Have To Die (for World of Warcraft)
===========================================


*Spot those bloody healers instantly and help them accomplish their destiny! (PVP and PVE)*


HHTD adds a big **red cross** over healer's name plates.  *You can't miss them!* (see the [screen-shot][redcross])

It also rings when you hover or target a hostile unit (PVP and/or PVE) who healed
someone else during the last 60 seconds (*can be configured*).

******************************************

*type /hhtdg to open the configuration interface, or /hhtd for command-line access*
