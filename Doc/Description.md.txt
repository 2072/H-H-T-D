Healers Have To Die
===================

*Spot those bloody healers instantly and help them accomplish their destiny!
(PVP and PVE)*

**Current features:**

- HHTD automatically adds healer symbols on top of players nameplate indicating
  their class and healing rank. Unlike other add-ons it only takes into account
  actively healing players. (**It uses different symbols for friends and foes**).

- HHTD lets you apply custom marks on top of any unit's nameplate. These are the
  same marks as the default raid markers but you can set as many as you want
  and customize their look.
  These marks persist across game sessions. (They are only visible to you)

**IMPORTANT NOTE: You have to enable nameplates, else you won't see any healer symbol!**

- Healer Have To Die lets you announce through a customizable message who the
  enemy and friendly healers are (using the Raid Warning channel if possible).

- It will also help you protect the healers who are on your side alerting you
  when they are being attacked (check the option panel for details).

- Helps you target healers easily when they are in a pack.

- All of this applies to PVP and PVE.

**NOTE: Type /HHTDG to open the configuration panel.** There are many settings
to check!

*HHTD's options are not directly available in the "Interface" panel due to ongoing tainting issues Blizzard is not willing to fix.*


How it works
------------

HHTD uses the combat log events to detect friendly and enemy healers who are
**currently** healing other players (during the last 60s).
HHTD detects [specialized healers spells][spelllist] (for human players only)
and differentiates specialized healers from hybrid ones.

HHTD also lets you choose a specified amount of healing healers have to
reach before being marked as such (50% of your own health by default).
This threshold is the only criterion used for NPCs.

When a healer is identified it will be marked with a healer symbol above
their nameplate. If the healer is specialized, the symbol's background
will be colored according to their class. In other cases the background will be
grey.

In all cases a number in the center of the symbol indicates the rank of the
healer, the lowest the number the better the healer (ie: '1' represents the
most effective healer while '9' is the least effective).

**You can force HHTD to only report specialized healers through HHTD's options (/hhtdg).**

Needless to say that self-heals and heals to pets are filtered out.


Commands
--------

- /HHTDP (or /hhtdp): Post healers name to the raid channel ordered by
  effectiveness for all to see (Will use the Raid Warning channel if possible).
  
  **You need to configure the messages in the announce module options first.**

**You can bind this command to a key (WoW key-bindings interface)**

- /HHTDG: Open option panel

- /HHTD: access to command line configuration interface (for changing settings
  through macros...)


Planned features
----------------

- Detection when a friendly healer is being attacked and alert others through
  /yell, /say and emote.


Compatibility
-------------

HHTD is only compatible with nameplate add-ons which have been coded
responsibly and do not modify internal parts of Blizzard nameplates (a very
selfish behaviour as it prevents any other add-on from re-using them).

HHTD will detect these incompatibilities and report to you so that you can ask
the culprit add-on authors to fix their code and make it compatible with ALL
nameplate add-ons.

**Guidelines for other add-on authors:**

- **Do not call :Hide() or :Show() on nameplates' base frame.** This breaks
  nameplate tracking for other add-ons by unduly firing OnHide/OnShow hooks...

  Instead, make its sub-frames invisible by changing their size and/or setting them to
  the _empty_ (not _nil_) texture. (check out how TidyPlates does)

- **Do not call :SetParent() on nameplates' subframes**, this would prevent other
  add-ons from finding and hooking nameplate elements.

- **Do not use SetScript() EVER.** You don't need it. :SetScript() shall only
  be used on frames  YOU create. You can simply replace all your SetScript()
  calls by HookScript().


Videos

Here is a video by Hybridpanda featuring HHTD in the *Eye of the Storm*
battleground:

Interview
---------

Curse.com interviewed me for an 'Add-on Spotlight' article focused on the
controversy around this add-on, you can find this interview [here][interview1].

Articles
--------

Here are two excellent articles about HHTD by Cynwise (**A must read if you
have some doubts about the fairness of this add-on!**) :

 [Healers Have To Die and the PvP Addons Arms Race][article1]

 [Using Healers Have To Die to Protect Friendly Healers][article3]

Debates
-------

An 'interesting' debate about this add-on is also happening on Blizzard's official forum:

- [Break the HHTD mod already. (UI and Macro forum)][debate4] (full),

- [Healers Have To Die, part I (UI and Macro forum)][debate1] (full),

- [Healers Have to Die, part III (General discussion)][debate3] (full),


Sadly, as a European I cannot participate but I'm reading those threads with great interest.

The funniest part about all those 26 pages discussions is that only about
**16,000 people were actually using HHTD at the time** (from the Curse Client
popularity statistics)... Now over **80,000** players have it installed!

In those discussions it's also rarely noted that HHTD is also very helpful to
protect healers on your side.  This debate is leading nowhere though... I won't
post any additional links to those endless threads.
