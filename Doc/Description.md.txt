Healers Have To Die (for World of Warcraft)
===========================================


*Now you can spot those nasty healers instantly and help them to accomplish their destiny!*


This is a very simple and light add-on. It rings when you hover or target
a hostile unit (PVP and/or PVE) who healed someone else during the last 60
seconds (*can be configured*).
HHTD also adds a **red cross** over healer's name plates. (see the [screen-shot][redcross])

******************************************

*type /hhtd to get a list of existing options through command line or use the graphical UI (/ace3)*
