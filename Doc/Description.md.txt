Healers Have To Die
===================


*Spot those bloody healers instantly and help them accomplish their destiny! (PVP and PVE)*


HHTD adds a **red cross** over *enemy* healer's name plates. *You can't miss them!* (see the [screen-shot][redcross]).

HHTD adds a **healer role symbol** above*friendly* healers' name plates. *Stop the slaughter!!*

**IMPORTANT NOTE: You have to enable name-plates, else you won't see the healer symbol!**

It also rings when you hover or target a hostile unit who healed
someone else during the last 60 seconds (*can be configured*).

HHTD is PVP and PVE compatible.

Remember to check out available options (/HHTDG)

Articles and debates
--------------------

Here is a excellent article about HHTD (**A must read if you have some doubts about the fairness of this add-on!**) :

 [http://cynwise.wordpress.com/2011/03/22/healers-have-to-die-and-the-pvp-addons-arms-race/][article1].


An interesting debate about this add-on is also happening on Blizzard's official forum:

- [Break the HHTD mod already. (UI and Macro forum)][debate4] (full),

- [Healers Have To Die, part I (UI and Macro forum)][debate1] (full),

- [Healers Have to Die, part II (General discussion)][debate2] (full),

- [Healers Have to Die, part III (General discussion)][debate3] (full),

- [Healers Have to Die (Class Roles - Healing forum)][debate5]

Sadly, as a European I cannot participate but I'm reading those threads with great interest.

The funniest part about all those 26 pages discussions is that only about **16,000 people are actually using HHTD** (from the Curse Client popularity statistics)...
*Note that with all the publicity made about HHTD, this number is increasing a lot faster than it used to.*

In those discussions it's also rarely noted that HHTD is also very helpful to protect healers on your side.
This debate is leading nowhere though... I won't post any more links to those endless threads.

How it works
------------

HHTD uses the combat log events to detect friendly and enemy healers.
By default, HHTD will detect specialized healers spells only (for PvP).

Another option lets you choose a specified amount of healing enemies have to
reach before being marked as healers. (this is the setting used for PvE)

Self-Heals and pets are filtered out.

Planned features
----------------

- Announce module for both friendly and enemy healers.
        For now I'm thinking to force it both ways at the same time ("focus XXX, protect XXX").
- Detection when a friendly healer is being attacked and alert others through /yell or /say (I would like to make it work for nearby healers only)

- Announce options will be disabled by default and users will have to write the announce text themselves. *there will be no default*
